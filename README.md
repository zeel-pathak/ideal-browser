#### An ideal way to Bypass the in-app browser

---

## Why?
I was scrolling through instagram and, got an amazing slide of top medium articles to read, and the link to them was given there in bio.
When i clicked on that link, the url was opened in instagram's in-app browser, which made me irritated because i was logged on medium.com on my browser and due to this in-app browser i wasn't able to read that article.
On further analysis, got to know that this was also the case with other mobile applications like Linkedin, twitter and facebook.
You can not open any url in external Browser, by default it opens in the application's in-app browser and to open that in external browser, you have to follow atleast two or three steps.

## Why Companies do it?
It can be understood from the snippet of an article I found on the Internet.
> In olden times, when mobile apps wanted to show web content, they would open the URL in the default browser. This caused the browser to become the active application, and depending on the platform, may have also required the user to perform more than just a single tap to return to the previous app. Keep in mind that this was happening while apps were just beginning to gain traction and marketers were scrambling to identify valuable metrics in this new app space. In the effort to keep metrics going “up and to the right”, it was only natural that publishers would want users to stay in “their” app for as long as possible, and lo! The in-app browser was conceived as a means to this end.*

## How I got the Idea?
While looking at the problem, the programmer's mind inside me, was like we need to bypass this in-app browser, without going through any step. There must be a way to bypass the in-app browser.

And on further BrainStorming, we can create a project in which any Web app can use our code and completely bypass the in-app browser, This way it gives more power to the Web-app developers and ease of access to users.
